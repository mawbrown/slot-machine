Python Slot Machine
This was a tutorial project from Tech with Tim on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I&t=129s
This project creates a slot machine in the console that allows the player to input a balance and play until that balance runs out.
You are able to select the number of lines to bet on and the amount to bet per line. Once you run out of money, you are no longer able to bet.
If you win, 3 matching symbols in a single row, the winning amount gets added to your total.
This tutorial taught me more about functions, loops, dictionaries and f strings.
